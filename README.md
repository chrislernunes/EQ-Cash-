# LINEAR-REGRESSION-NSEI-RELIANCE-


Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x). The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the model.

To evaluate the performance of a linear regression model, two key metrics are commonly used: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared. RMSE measures the average difference between the observed and predicted values, with a lower RMSE indicating a better model. R-squared represents the squared correlation between the observed and predicted values, with a higher R-squared indicating a better model.

The following steps outline a general workflow for building a predictive linear regression model:

Split the data into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) randomly.
Train the regression model using the training set.
Use the test set to make predictions and calculate the accuracy metrics (e.g. RMSE and R-squared).
It's important to note that while linear regression is a widely used method, it may not always be the best approach for a given dataset, and other modeling techniques may be better suited.
