##### This notebook is entirely informative. None of the content presented in this notebook constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment.

##### There are many many more details to explore - in choosing data features, in choosing algorithms, in tuning the algos, etc. I am sure there are many unaswered parts of the process. So, any comments and suggestion - please do share. I'd be happy to add and test any ideas in the current process.

##### Thanks for reading.
